<h3>Submission Site</h3>

<p>The submission site is <a href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2017/">
    https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2017/</a>. </p>


<p>The deadline for uploading the final version of your paper is <b>Mar 1, 2017</b>.</p>

<p>To prepare your final paper, please change the string<br>
<code>\usepackage{aistats2017}</code><br>
to<br>
<code>\usepackage[accepted]{aistats2017}</code><br>
in you LaTeX source file.  Please do not modify the layout given by the style
file. If you have questions about the style file or its usage, please
contact the workflow chairs.

<p>
In the CMT <a
href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2017/Protected/Author/">Author
Console</a>, there is now a new column labeled &ldquo;Camera
Ready,&rdquo; and in this column, for each accepted paper, a link
labeled &ldquo;Edit.&rdquo; Use this link to submit camera-ready papers.
The CMT form will ask you for
the list of authors, the title, the abstract, and the following files
(where 642 is to be replaced by your paper ID):

<pre>
642.pdf
642-supp.xxx    (optional)
</pre>

If a supplementary file is included, its type xxx can be pdf, zip, tgz
or gz. In addition, you will be asked to provide submission code obtained
by an automated style checker and confirm that you agree with having
your work published in the proceedings.
</p>

<ol>
<li> Please ensure that the submitted title and abstract match the
ones in the camera-ready version, and do not include any LaTeX commands or
other non-human-readable markup.</li>

<li> Please ensure that the submitted list of authors and the ordering
among them matches the camera-ready version.</li>

<li> Please make sure any supplementary material is submitted as a
separate file and not appended to the main paper.</li>

<li> In preparing the camera-ready version, we request that you take
into account reviewer and meta-reviewer feedback.
Your camera-ready submission should be named 642.pdf (with 642
replaced by your paper ID).  We only accept pdf
files.  Please ensure that your camera-ready submission contains
author information (instead of &ldquo;Anonymous Author N&rdquo; as
was required for the original submission), and that you use the
standard style as provided above.
See detailed instructions for preparing the camera-ready paper in
Section 3 of the file sample_paper.pdf, included with the style files.</li>

<li> Please verify that your paper follows the style requirements by
submitting your pdf file to the
<a 
href="http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/pub/AISTATS2017/">
style checking script</a>. You will need to provide the paper ID,
your name (just one author), your e-mail and the pdf file. If the paper passes
the style checks, you will obtain a submission code. (Please
ignore the warnings of the style checker.) The CMT form
will ask you to provide this submission code.</li>

<li> The final version will appear in the proceedings, published by JMLR
W&amp;CP. The CMT will ask you to agree to have your
work published by JMLR according to the agreement outlined
<a
href="http://jmlr.org/proceedings/jmlrPublicationForm.pdf">here</a>.
Please print this form, sign it and upload a scanned version as a supplementary file.</li>

<li> You may optionally submit supplementary material, e.g., detailed
proofs, code, data, or slides.  Please submit these as
642-supp.xxx (with 642 replaced by your paper ID and xxx
replaced by the file type).
If the supplementary material includes multiple files, please
compress these into a single zip, tgz or gz file.</li>

<li> You may continue to edit your camera-ready
submissions until the camera-ready deadline.</li>
</ol>
