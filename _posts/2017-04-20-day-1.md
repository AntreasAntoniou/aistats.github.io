    abstract: "Learning and decision making often conflict: A decision maker who is uncertain about its environment may need to choose actions whose main benefit is to gain information rather gaining reward. The dilemma between exploration and exploitation is at the heart of bandit problems.  In this talk I will focus on the so-called stochastic linear bandits where the payoff function is assumed to posses a linear structure, an assumption that proved to be extremely effective elsewhere in machine learning. Here we look into how the linear structure can be exploited in bandits. I will discuss existing results and open questions. The issues discussed will include limits of performance of bandit algorithms, how to design efficient and effective algorithms, or how to exploit additional information like sparsity."
    bio: "Csaba Szepesvari is interested in designing principled learning algorithms for agents that learn from and control their environments. He is the author or coauthor of two books on the topic, as well as nearly 200 journal and conference papers. He is best known as the co-inventor of 'UCT', a tree-search algorithm that inspired much subsequent work in AI, search and optimization and serves, among other things, as the basis of the search component in AlphaGo, Deepmind's Go program that defeated a top human Go player in the beginning of 2016. His work on UCT was recently recognized by the 'Test of Time' award at ECML'2016. Csaba serves as an action editor of the Journal of Machine Learning Research and the Machine Learning Journal. He also served as a co-chair for COLT and ALT and has served as a senior PC member for first-tier AI and machine learning conferences for too many years. Currently Csaba is a Professor at the Department of Computing Science of the University of Alberta and a Principal Investigator of the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (AMII). From August, he will be joining Deepmind, London."
