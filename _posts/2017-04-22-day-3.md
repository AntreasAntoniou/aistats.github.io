    abstract: "'Interactive learning' refers to scenarios in which a learning agent (human or machine) engages with an information-bearing agent or system (for instance, a human expert) with the goal of efficiently arriving at a useful model. Examples include: active learning of classifiers; automated teaching systems; augmenting unsupervised learning with interactive post-editing; and so on. In particular, such interaction is a basic mechanism by which we can communicate our needs and preferences to the computers that play an increasing role in our lives. It would be helpful to have unifying mathematical frameworks that can provide a basis for evaluating interactive schemes, and that supply generic interaction algorithms. I will describe one such mathematical framework, that covers a fairly broad range of situations, and illustrate how it yields algorithms for interactive hierarchical clustering and interactive topic modeling."
    bio: "Sanjoy Dasgupta is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego. He received his PhD at UC Berkeley in 2000. He works on algorithms for machine learning, with a focus on unsupervised and interactive learning. He is the author of a textbook, 'Algorithms', with Christos Papadimitriou and Umesh Vazirani. He was program co-chair for the Conference on Learning Theory (COLT) in 2009 and for the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) in 2013."
