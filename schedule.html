Is there always a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability? This is a very old AI question. Many people have claimed that they have investigated the answer to this question, but it is not clear that these attempts have been truly serious. If we try to investigate this claim by comparing interpretable modeling algorithms (like decision trees - say CART, C4.5) to a black box method that optimizes only accuracy (SVM or neural networks), we will not find the answer. This is not a fulfilling comparison - the methods for producing interpretable models are greedy myopic methods with no global objective, whereas the black box algorithms have global objectives and principled optimization routines. In order to actually answer this question, we would have to compare an "optimal" interpretable model to an optimal black box model. This means we actually need optimality for interpretable models. This, of course, leads to computationally hardness, which scares us. On the other hand, we have computing power like never before. So do we truly know what we are afraid of any more? 
In this talk I will discuss algorithms for interpretable machine learning. Some of these algorithms are designed to create certificates of nearness to optimality. I will focus on some of our most recent work, including (1) work on optimal rule list models using customized bounds and data structures (these are an alternative to CART) (2) work on optimal scoring systems (alternatives to logistic regression + rounding). Further, since we have methods that can produce optimal or near-optimal models, we can use them to produce interesting new forms of interpretable models. These new forms were simply not possible before, since they are almost impossible to produce using traditional techniques (like greedy splitting and pruning). In particular: (3) Falling rule lists, (4) Causal falling rule lists, and (5) Cost-effective treatment regimes. Work on (1) is joint with postdoc Elaine Angelino, students Nicholas Larus-Stone and Daniel Alabi, and colleague Margo Seltzer. Work on (2) is joint with student Berk Ustun. Work on (3) and (4) are joint with students Fulton Wang and Chaofan Chen, and (5) is an AISTATS 2017 paper that is joint work with student Himabindu Lakkaraju.<br>

<i>"Interactive learning" refers to scenarios in which a learning agent (human or machine) engages with an information-bearing agent or system (for instance, a human expert) with the goal of efficiently arriving at a useful model. Examples include: active learning of classifiers; automated teaching systems; augmenting unsupervised learning with interactive post-editing; and so on. In particular, such interaction is a basic mechanism by which we can communicate our needs and preferences to the computers that play an increasing role in our lives.
It would be helpful to have unifying mathematical frameworks that can provide a basis for evaluating interactive schemes, and that supply generic interaction algorithms. I will describe one such mathematical framework, that covers a fairly broad range of situations, and illustrate how it yields algorithms for interactive hierarchical clustering and interactive topic modeling.<br>
