<h1>AISTATS 2017 Instructions for Presenters</h1><br>


<h3>Poster Presentations</h3>

The poster boards are 1.2m (4 ft) in height and 1.8m (6 ft) in width. Your poster may be either in landscape or in portrait orientation.<br><br>

All posters should be removed immediately following the sessions in which they were presented. Posters for the next session should go up no sooner than after the morning session.<br><br>


<h3>Oral Presentations</h3>

For each oral presentation, 25 minutes will be provided, including Q&A discussion and transition time. We recommend presenters to prepare a 22-minute talk, which will spare a few minutes for questions and transition between speakers.  Speakers please contact the session chair 15 minutes before the start of the session and try out laptop and slides.<br><br>

The conference room does not furnish a computer. Presenters are encouraged to bring their own laptop with the slides on it, together with any necessary connectors.  If it is not possible, presenters may contact the session chair or one of the organizing committee members well before the conference to arrange for alternatives.<br><br>

Please note that all papers presented as talks also have a corresponding poster presentation.<br><br>
