<b>Bio</b> 
Adam Tauman Kalai received his BA (1996) from Harvard, and MA (1998) and PhD
(2001) under the supervision of Avrim Blum from CMU. After an NSF postdoctoral
fellowship at M.I.T. with Santosh Vempala, he served as an assistant professor
at the Toyota Technological institute at Chicago and then at Georgia Tech. He
is now a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research New England. His honors
include an NSF CAREER award and an Alfred P. Sloan fellowship. His research
focuses on human computation, machine learning, and algorithms.

<p><b>Random projection ensemble classification</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract</b> 
We introduce a very general method for high-dimensional classification, based
on careful combination of the results of applying an arbitrary base classifier
to random projections of the feature vectors into a lower-dimensional space. In
one special case that we study in detail, the random projections are divided
into non-overlapping blocks, and within each block we select the projection
yielding the smallest estimate of the test error. Our random projection
ensemble classifier then aggregates the results of applying the base classifier
on the selected projections, with a data-driven voting threshold to determine
the final assignment. Our theoretical results elucidate the effect on
performance of increasing the number of projections. Moreover, under a boundary
condition implied by the sufficient dimension reduction assumption, we show
that the test excess risk of the random projection ensemble classifier can be
controlled by terms that do not depend on the original data dimension. The
classifier is also compared empirically with several other popular
high-dimensional classifiers via an extensive simulation study, which reveals
its excellent finite-sample performance.

<b>Bio</b> 
Richard Samworth is Professor of Statistics in the Statistical Laboratory at
the University of Cambridge, and currently holds a GBP 1.2M Engineering and
Physical Sciences Research Council Early Career Fellowship.  He received his
PhD in Statistics, also from the University of Cambridge, in 2004.  Richard's
main research interests are in nonparametric and high-dimensional statistical
inference.  Particular research topics include shape-constrained density and
other nonparametric function estimation problems, nonparametric classification,
clustering and regression, Independent Component Analysis, bagging and
high-dimensional variable selection problems.  Richard was awarded the Royal
Statistical Society (RSS) Research prize (2008), the RSS Guy Medal in Bronze
(2012) and a Philip Leverhulme prize (2014).  He has been elected a Fellow of
the Institute for Mathematical Statistics (2014) and the American Statistical
Association (2015).
